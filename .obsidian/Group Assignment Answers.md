SMTP is simple Mail Transfer Protocol that relay on TCP/IP protocol in  sending and receiving the email , but it is typically uses full for sending messages rather than receiving because SMTP is typically limited to and relied on to send messages from a sender to a recipient. it can't queue messages ,Â Post Office Protocol 3 ([POP3](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/POP3-Post-Office-Protocol-3)) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), which lets the user save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically from a server. the server is like any server or computer uses the TCP on port 25 and 587 to send , receive and relay email.

SMTP servers are set to an always-on listening mode and as soon as a server detects a TCP connection from a client, the SMTP process initiates a connection to port 25 to send the email.
