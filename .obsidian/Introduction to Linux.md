Linux is a  kernel code/program that used your for integration of  software and Hardware. And allocate resources.

# history of Linux

in 1969 a  team led by computer scientists Ke Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 mini computer.

At that time the OS has some limitations ,wasn't free user friendly
A person called Linus Threvolds write the kernel of Linux using C language 
in 1983 Richard Stallman announced the GNU Project in 1983 and cofounded the Free Software foundation in 1985.

GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS . But it was just software replacement not full OS {Examples: Bashes, tar , emacs}

The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copies, modified and redistributed


## What is Shell?
Command line interpreter (CLI)Users can communicate with kernel by the shell .
The Shell translates commands entered by the user and converted them into a language that id understood by the Kernel. 

***Types of shells commands

based on their features there are money shells

- SH
- BASH
  SH
  FISH
They differ in Coloring , Piping command compilation 

### 1. sh (Bourne Shell)

- **The original shell:** It's the grandfather of modern shells, providing a basic command-line interface.
- **Compact and fast:** Known for its efficiency and simplicity.
- **Limited features:** Lacks advanced features like command history, job control, and arithmetic expansion.
- **Common use:** Often used as a fallback or for very basic scripting.

### 2. Bash (Bourne Again SHell)

- **Most common shell:** The default on many Linux distributions.
- **Superset of sh:** Includes all sh features plus a vast array of enhancements.
- **Interactive and scripting:** Excellent for both interactive use and complex scripting.
- **Key features:** Command history, job control, aliases, functions, scripting capabilities, and more.

### 3. fish (Friendly Interactive SHell)

- **Modern and user-friendly:** Designed for ease of use and a pleasant experience.
- **Interactive focus:** Prioritizes features like auto-suggestions, syntax highlighting, and tab completion.
- **Different syntax:** Uses a unique syntax compared to sh and Bash.
- **Growing popularity:** Gaining traction due to its user-friendly approach.

### Key Differences

| Feature     | sh                        | Bash                       | fish                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Origin      | Original Unix shell       | Superset of sh             | Modern shell               |
| Focus       | Basic commands            | Interactive and scripting  | User-friendly, interactive |
| Features    | Limited                   | Extensive                  | Modern, user-centric       |
| Syntax      | Traditional               | Traditional                | Different                  |
| Typical use | Basic scripting, fallback | General-purpose, scripting | Interactive use, scripting |

### Choosing the Right Shell

- **Beginners:** fish is often recommended for its user-friendliness.
- **Scripting:** Bash is the most versatile choice due to its extensive features and wide support.
- **Efficiency:** sh can be suitable for very basic scripts or when performance is critical.
- **Personal preference:** Ultimately, the best shell is the one you feel comfortable with.

**Remember:** You can switch between shells by setting the `SHELL` environment variable. For example, to use Bash:

Bash

```
export SHELL=/bin/bash
```
