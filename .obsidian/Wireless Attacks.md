- a network is a connection between two or more points, systems , computers.
- A wireless network is a set of two or more devices connected with each other via radio waves within a limited space range. fast accessibility and cheap installation are among the features of Wireless network.
- types of networks 
     - WIFI(Wire less fidelity)
     - uses a radio wave that provide high speed- internet and network uses 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz network bands
    - They Contains some **Common Standards** with higher/lower speed and range.

	- Bluetooth uses a radio wave that propagate for short range connection that allows to exchange data up to 100 meters. operates in 2.4 GHz range.

	- Zigbee used in IOT technologies with low-power consumption , low-data rate wireless networks standard .Operated in 2.4 GHz, 915MHz and 868 MHz 
- Applications
- Smart home devices (lighting, security, energy management).
    
	- NFC used for closed (4cm) connection for exchange data between two devices.**
- Applications
- Contactless payments, ID verification, and data sharing between devices.with  some vulnerabilities like eavesdropping card cloning data modification, and relay attack if not encrypted.

	- Cellular Networks(3G,4G,5G) : wire less technologies used for mobile phone networks and data transmission over large distances.
	- Frequency Bands
- Varies based on region and generation, using licensed spectrum.
- Applications
- Mobile voice communication, mobile data (internet access), and multimedia streaming.
- Vulnerabilities
- Man-in-the-middle attacks, IMSI catchers, and vulnerabilities in older generations (e.g., 3G).

### What is Wireless Hacking

- is cracking security protocols to find vulnerability, by remoting accessing it. 
- Wireless Networks are some kind of signals, they need some Decoders and Encoders.
- Encoder :Convert data into a radio signal for transmission.
- Decoder: used to change back the signal into data
- we have Access Points(AP) is a device that transmits and receives data over wireless local area network (WLAN).
- Hackers can access to this networks because they are waves and our device that can easily decode it.
- Most attackers use network sniffing find the SSID and hack wireless network.
- When our wireless cards(decoder/encoder) are converted in sniffing modes, they are called monitor mode
- And when your Wireless card allows to configure a AP on your laptop manually it is called Managed mode.
 To do most wireless Hacking , you need a device that can intercept or handle that specific signal
-  a WIFI -Antenna used as wifi card it is efficient Packet Injection + Monitor mode
- SSID/Service set Identifier/: it is the name of the Access Point
- BSSID/Basic Service Set Identifier/: Mac Address of the Wireless AP device.
- WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network,   same as wifi
- Channel: are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands that are used by your wireless network to send and receive data. Depending on which frequency band your router is using, you have a certain number of WiFi channels to choose from:
- 13 WiFi channels are in the 2.4 GHz frequency band
- 45 WiFi channels are in the 5 GHz frequency band.
- wireless Encryption protocols are algorithm that uses to secure networks
- There are Four kinds of WLAN Security Algorithms
- **WEP : uses RC4 stream cipher 40 bit  key Encryption, with static key 
- **WPA a replacement of WEP, it uses **temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP) Encryption,** with pre shared key for users.
- **WPA2 : uses AES encryption 
- **WPA3 : uses WIFI DPP system that allow user most secured connection **In addition, WPA3 security uses GCMP-256 encryption rather than the previously used 128-bit AES encryption.
- Even if a user’s password is weak, WPA3 provides a more secure handshake using Wi-Fi DPP.
- WPA3 devices became widely available in 2019 and are backwards compatible with devices that use the WPA2 protocol.
    #### methodology to hack wifi
1. WPS enabled
2. Handshake Brute force
3. WEP Attack
4. Evil-twin attack
## Prevention

- Avoid Wi-Fi networks marked as “Unsecure”
- Use your own hotspot
- Disable Wi-Fi autosave 
- Use a VPN
- Only browse HTTPS sites

    ## SS7 Attack
- An SS7 attack is a security exploit that takes advantage of a weakness in the design of SS7 (Signaling System 7) to enable data theft, eavesdropping, text interception and location tracking.
    
- To allow wireless cellular and wired connection, the SS7 phone signalling protocols are in charge of initiating and ending phone calls across a digital signalling network. Most international public phone calls are made over the Public Switched Telephone Network.
    
- Other apps were gradually incorporated into SS7. This made it possible to roll out new mass-market solutions, including call waiting, SMS, prepaid billing, number translation, call forwarding, local number portability, and conference calling.
    
- For this purpose you need a device that can intercept a cellular signals.
