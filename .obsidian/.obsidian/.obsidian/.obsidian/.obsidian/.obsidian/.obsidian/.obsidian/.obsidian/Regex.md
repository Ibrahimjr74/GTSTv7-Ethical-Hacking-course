- used to filter Validation on any platform done by Regular expression /regex/.
- These are patterns that help to filter so texts ,space, tabs& symbols.
- Regex used on Linux tools called grep,awk and sed
- to demonstrate just go to vs code and turn on the regex button
- On regex \n, \t are called meta characters
## Meta characters
Those are regex pattern symbols for filter.
They are:
    -  . Used to get All the  line except new lines
    - ^(caret) Used to get line that start with pattern
    - $ Used  to get line that ends with that pattern
    - *  Asterisk filters all with on repetition boundary
    - + plus sign used to filter repeated pattern
    - ? filters
    - { } Curly Bracket Used to get line that have pattern that occur min and max 
    - [ ] Square Brackets  
    - ( )
    - | (or) for piping for two selection 
    - \ escape to used meta characters  as regex
\w and \W \s
-\w filters alpha numeric filters except alpha numeric 
\s filters the white spaces , \S filters Beyond white space 
\d used to filters numbers \D filters with out numbers



## Bash For Regex
- We use =~ operator for regex check with if condition statement

## Bash else if
- when dealing with more than one conditions
- it is similar with elif

## For loops
- for conditions that outcome is known for certain amount of time
- We can use arrays like list on python but we don't have range in bash but we can do {a..b}  this iterates from a to b

***Normal loop

- On Bash i++ = i +1
- i-- =i-=1
## For Loop with increment/decrement

Same syntax with index slicing but here it is for looping.  -  {start..stop..step}

## Until loop

- It is same but this one exits the loop when the expression is true.
- The name until means እስከ
