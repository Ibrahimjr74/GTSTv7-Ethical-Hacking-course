##what is Programming language
- It is language which helps to comminate with computers // they are not able to understand human languages
- we humans lots of language(english,france,amharic,arabic..)
- Computers have many languages too
- like Assembly++,Java,Js,Pyhton,Ruby,Perl,Go
- So programming language helps us to write a computer program/
###What is Program?
- A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming language.
- An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to accomplish some task. Named after an Iranian mathematician Al Khwarizmi.
- Technically, an algorithm, must reach a result after s finite number of steps
- with those steps Programs Do a Specific task Correctly.
- in Early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on punch cards all the data and Out put as to a line printer
- Later on interactive processing was developed which allows us to provide the data while the program, is running , it takes places in Q & A Format
##Types  of  Programming Language

- Computers Understand binary(0/1), humans don't understand this
- The more they become low to the machine they are faster, vice versa
- so base on the closeness of the language humans we classify 
A) Low level programming language
- these language are more like machines but with lots of wffor people can understand them. They are close to the hardware of the computer.
B) High level Programming languages
- They are more close to human ; Ex python ,C++,Java,js
```
class Triangle{
flaot surface()
return b * h / 2
}
```
C) Medium level
- Language Between Low level; and High level, they combine both
- Ex- C-lang

##How do high level languages work?
1. Compilers: are toold which hekos to convert thr whole code to bytecode then comouter will execute it : 
2. Interpreter can directly execute the code by reading

##Uses of Programming language
- $$ Android Application, web development, machine learnig, AI, Game development,Big data Technologies, Develping Desktop softwares, Developing Hacking tools

What is Python Programming?
- Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the klate eightlies and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Sceience inthe Netherlands.
- Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It’s everywhere, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis
- Pyhton is a High level & interprete level language .
- easy to learn and adapt

## IDE & Code editors
- IDE : is Software that helps to write & run a Specific Programminn language.Example IDE
- Code Editors: are software those can help to write any kind of programming lanuages.
#To display output we say
print('Hello')
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)

'''

print(): Displays values to the console.

input(): Reads user input.

'''

# variables are a value holders/containers and they store data

#The process of giving value to variable is calles variable Declaration

#The woed that holds the data is called identifier

'''
 variable name can be alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscore (_).
print('Welcome GTST to Python')

print('Programming is Fun!\n')

print('Hackers can code')
print('Welcome GTST','toPyhton' ,sep=", ")

gtst = 10

print("you are " ,gtst, "Years old")

gtst = 30

print(f"you are {gtst} Years old")
'''

# comments: are often ignored by the compliler and it is simple notes written on our codes those helps
'''

This is multiple line comments

'''

# data types : int(integer), float,complex

# Stirng Data Types : Assinged in quotes

# Sequence Data Types: Liat of an orders collection of similar or different types of items separated by command and enclosed by brackets

languages = ["Swift", "java", "python"]
print(languages)

#Tuple is an orderd sequence of items same as a list.The only diffrences is tulples are immutable, once they are created they are not modified.

#Dictionary : Python dictionary is an unorderd collection of items. Ot stores elements in key/value pairs
