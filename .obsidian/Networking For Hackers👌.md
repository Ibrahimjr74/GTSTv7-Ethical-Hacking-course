- A network consists of two or more computers connected to  Enhance communication , Facilitate centralized management Internet share documents  and information.
ARPANET is the largest computer network invented by US Military, it is basically packet-switched network Implemented to facilitate communication, to share information, to work on researchs
NSFET - national science network foundation networked developed for military purposes, which later evolves to internet communication

- **The network becomes a powerful tool when computers communicate and share resources with other computers on the same network or entirely distinct networks.**
- 
## client
User computer that request resources
## server
**A server is a computer that controls and provides access to resources.**

- they have their own OS
  - With high ram storage and computing server
  - Server rack consists of switch, Modern, servers
  -Firewall Display
## Classification by Network Geography

- classified by topography of place like WAN, MAN, LAN .
## LAN
connects between small range of area, like classrooms, home.
- LANs are inexpensive to install also provides high speeds

## MAN
Metropolitan area network connects towns city's, they are often higher costy to install Use high speed connections such as fiber optics to achieve higher speeds
## CAN
Campus area network 
## WAN

- These use long distance telecommunication networks for connection, thereby increasing the cost.
- The Internet is a good example of a WAN
## PAN
person to person network


## Classification by Component Roles

- Networks can also be classified according to the roles that the networked computers play in the network’s operation.
    
- Peer-to-peer, server-based, and client-based are the types of roles into which networks are classified
## Peer-to-peer

- the client based computers connect computer s that can handle  the pressure
- In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, every computer plays an equal role, managing its own data and acting as both a client and a server as needed. This decentralized structure makes P2P networks inexpensive and simple to set up, making them ideal for home networks and small businesses. Most operating systems include built-in P2P capabilities.
While P2P networks are scalable, there's a practical limit to the number of peers that can efficiently interact. Typically, ten is considered a reasonable maximum for effective performance.

**Key Features of P2P Networks:**

- **Decentralization:** No central server controls the network.
- **Resource Sharing:** Peers share files and other resources directly with each other.
- **Flexibility:** Each peer can act as both a client and a server.
- **Ease of Setup:** P2P networks are generally easy to configure.

## Server Based
**A dedicated server is one that services the network by storing data, applications, resources, and also provides access to resources required by the client.**

## Client-based

- Client-based network servers process requests from clients and return just the results.
- These networks take advantage of the powerful processing capabilities of both the client and the server.
    
## IP/Internet Protocol/ address
- A unique identifier to identify machines on a network or a set of rules to communicate through the network
### IP types and versions
- IPV4 :- **
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit sequence of 1s and 0s.
- To make the IP address easier to use, the address is usually written as four decimal numbers separated by periods. 
- This way of writing the address is called the dotted decimal format.
- IP generated by DHCP or Manually
## Private and Public IP addresses

- Any HOST have 2 different IP’s
- Public IP:
-  is an Ip address that is given to the host on the WAN network
- Private IP:
-  is Ip that is given to the host on LAN network

- **IPV6**
- IPv6 is a 128-bit alphanumeric long value that identifies an endpoint devices in IPv6 network.
- Format of an IPv6 address:
- FE80:CD00:0000:0CDE:1257:0000:211E:729C
- ALPHA Numeric
- Separated by colon(:)
- IP generated automatically.
- The main difference is the IP-space(host holding) IPv4 holds 32-bit Ip address but IPv6 holds 128-bit Ip Addresses.

## MAC Address
- It is Given by A manufacturer of that  network adapter
## OSI Reference model
- Back in Days, Different Company Devices can’t Communicate or create network
- OSI Reference Model - internationally standardized network architecture.
- Specified in ISO 7498.
- It is an idea model to show the way of network work
- Model has 7 layers.
- It shows How Data transfers between 2 hosts/servers

## TCP and UDP

What Is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)?

- Reliable
- Connection-Oriented protocol
- Means it establishes a connection between the receiver and sender. 
- It uses 3 way Handshake ( more on Network Hacking )
- Used on emails, Chat, watching online videos, simple browsing
## What is UDP
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is ==a protocol that allows data to be transferred across networks without establishing a connection between the source and destination==. UDP is a message-oriented protocol that sends data in chunks called datagrams, and it's well-suited for real-time communication and broadcast systems. It is less reliable, but faster and more straightforward.


**TCP/IP model**
- It is A reference model like the OSI model 
- Short way to remember All, peoples , seems , to , need , data , processing
which means Application layer, Presentaion layer, Session layer, transport layer, Network layer,Data link layer, Physical layer

- TCP/IP is the new and most used Model it this time.
- This model have 4 layers(used to be 5 layer)
- Application, Presentation and session layers are combined together and called APPLICATION
- Data link layer and physical layer combined and called network access layer.
 In Layer 7: PROTOCOLS: HTTP,FTP,SMTP
 In Layer 6: data encryption and data compression protocol SSL
 In Layer 5: Session performs token managment and synchronization. PROTOCOLS: RPC,NETBIOS
 In Layer 4: Transport layer Datas are Segments  Manages transmission packets
Repackages long messages when necessary into small packets for transmission [ sender ]
Reassembles packets in correct order to get the original message. [ receiver ]
Handles error recognition and recovery. 
Transport layer at receiving acknowledges packet delivery. 
Resends missing packets
In Layer 3:Manages addressing/routing of data within the ip range
Addresses messages and translates logical addresses and names into physical addresses. 
Determines the route from the source to the destination computer 
Manages traffic problems, such as switching, routing, and controlling the congestion of data packets.
Your data is PACKETS
PROTOCOLS: ICMP,ARP,NAT,
In Layer 2: Data Link Layer:Packages raw bits from the Physical layer into frames (logical, structured packets for data).  [ receiver ]
Provides reliable transmission of frames 
## Firewall

- A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.
    
- It is Just A collection of rules to allow and deny network traffics
    
- Ex: You can’t directly access some host directly from other Network.
## Devices
- Routers - used for network communication 
- Switches Used to connect computers ,devices
       -  it used to connect send message to APN 
       - used to make  forwarding decisions, Uses the MAC Address to populate the CAM Table by recording the source MAC Address Switch port that the frame arrived on.
       - 
- Firewalls - Protect device from unwanted connections

# Wire less networks

- The Access points connect to the switch and devices often connected with radio signals connections
## Subnetting

- A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network
-  computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses.
                      Steps

          - identify the class of the IP addresses and note the Default subnet Mask.
          - convert the Default subnet Mask into Binary
          - Note the number of hosts required per subnet and find the Subnet Generator (SG) and octet position.
          - Generate the new subnet mask
          - Use the SG and generate the network ranges (subnets) in the appropriate octet position.


**Subnet mask 
- is a term used to specify How many bits are given to the network and how many are given to the host
 Class A : 255.0.0.0
 Class B:  255.255.0.0
 Class C:  255.255.255.0

## CIDR range
 - determining the network and host by just looking
