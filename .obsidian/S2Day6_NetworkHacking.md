**Network hacking** refers to the process of exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities in a computer network to gain unauthorized access, control, or information. This can include attacking devices, servers, or routers, intercepting data, and manipulating or disrupting network services. 

Common network hacking activities include:
1. **Sniffing**: Capturing and analyzing data packets traveling through the network.
  - There are two types of sniffing Active Sniffing and passive Sniffing  the one is scanning, controlling with changing that pass through the network. where as the latter one only monitors the network traffic.
  - Wireshark is well known passive monitoring tool.it is a network analyzing tool with passive control. checking the network called Catching.
  ### what is ARP /Address Resolution Protocol/
  - TO change Ip Address the to mac address
  - A command Line tool that will Display the Mac Table Cached on our computer.
  - to know more about the connection between computers.
  - Mac flooding is method of attacking by sending fake Mac-address to the mac address table. which may lead to damage of the switch.
1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Intercepting communication between two parties without their knowledge.
2. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading a network to make services unavailable.
3. **IP Spoofing**: Pretending to be a trusted IP to gain unauthorized access.
4. **Password Cracking**: Gaining access by exploiting weak or compromised passwords.

### DOS and DDOS Attacks
- Denial of service attacks, and Distributed Denial-of-service attack.
- it crashes servers and website by overwhelming the network with access requests from 







Network hacking can be either ethical (for security testing) or malicious, depending on the intent.
