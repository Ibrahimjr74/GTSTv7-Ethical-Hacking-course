## What is malware

- A Malware is  a set of instructions(program) that run on a certain system, that can cause severe damage or  for purpose that is made for. the goal of malware is to cause havoc and steal information or resources for monetary gain or sheer sabotage intent.
- "Malicious"+ "Software" = Malware

### what  malwares do exactly

1. Removing data/files
    
2. Encrypting data/files
    
3. Corrupting data/files
    
4. Stealing Data/files
    
5. Spying on user

6. Disruption and intrusion, intelligence

#### Types of Malwares

1. **Trojan
- Trojan is a type of malicious code of software that looks legitimate but after installing or using it it can cause Harms to our component.
 #### Common types of trojan
a. Backdoor Trojan
- this Trojan can create back door on our computer. it lets an attacker compose and control it
 2. Mail finder Trojan
a. This Trojan seeks to steel the email addresses you've accumulated on our device

  3. Remote Access Trojan
  a. This trojan can give an attacker a access out side the server  via a remote network connection. Its uses include stealing your information or spying on you.
    
   a) C2 Servers(Command and Control): This is a server which the malware communicate with, to pass commands to the malware also to have control over the malware to send and receive data.

  4. Trojan Banker
  a. Stealing accounts, credential of persons organization like banking credit card and bill pay data.

5. worm
- After propagate to computer can replicate itself through LAN networks and cause damage
6. Virus
- The first to be found malicious software attached to a document or file that supports macros to execute its code and spread from host to host. Once downloaded, the virus will lie dormant until the file is opened and in use. Viruses are designed to disrupt a system's ability to operate. **Viruses can also replicate themselves.**
- As a result, viruses can cause significant operational issues and data loss.

## Common signs of virus infection
- Speed of System
- Pop-up windows
- Self-executing
- Account being log out
- Crashing of device
- Mass emails being sent from you
- Files and system settings are altered
    
Common types of virus
1. Resident Virus :*Viruses propagate themselves by infecting applications on a host computer.
2. Multipartite Virus: A multipartite virus uses multiple methods to infect and spread across computers. It will typically remain in the computer’s memory to infect the hard disk, then spread through and infect more drives by altering the content of applications. This results in performance lag and application memory running low.
4. Browser Hijacker: A browser hijacker manually changes the settings of web browsers, such as replacing the homepage, editing the new tab page, and changing the default search engine. Technically, it is not a virus because it cannot infect files

### Ransomware

- Asking for return for some one's file encryption.
- A user or organization’s critical data is encrypted so that they cannot access files, databases, or applications
- A ransom is then demanded to provide access.
- Ransomware is often designed to spread across a network and target database and file servers, and can thus quickly paralyze an entire organization.
- Ransomware =>   RANSOM    +     SOFTWARE
### Rootkit
- **Rootkits allow attackers to maintain persistent control over a system, evade detection by security software, and perform various malicious activities.**
- combined with remotley accessing trojan a hacker can handle system Admistrator as root ...
### Adware
- is un intended or unwanted types of advertisement  that shows pop ups and  will explode our desktop and can change home page , add spy ware.There are two main types of adware, namely **malicious and legitimate adware**. Most adware can be categorized as browser hijackers. This type of intrusive adware alters your device's web browser settings without your knowledge or permission.
### Botnet
- A network of compromised devices controlled by a single entity for malicious purposes.
- Botnets are typically used for malicious activities such as launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam emails, stealing data, or performing other cybercrimes

**Macro malware hides in Microsoft Office files and is delivered as email attachments or inside ZIP files**. These files use names that are intended to entice or scare people into opening them.



#### Infection techniques
- USB drop attack (infected removable drivers)
- Spam emails(inside there exist malware)
- Malicious Office macros
- Software/Applications, Torrent sites
- Using Cracked Software's
- Malicious Browser extension
	
## Anti-Virus(AV) Software's

- A security tool used to identify, scan , prevent and remove malicious software from our device
- Type of *Antivirus
- Signature-Based Detection
-The antivirus software checks file against the database pattern (signature) , will check and scan.**Ineffective against new or modified malware (zero-day threats), Means UPDATE is MUST**

- Heuristic-Bases Detection
-Analyzes **The behavior** of the program to identify suspicious activities that could indicate the presence of malware.
if a certain program trys to access or modify, to grant permission, copy file etc..
-But this may lead to trigger for alert to innocent activity.
- Sandboxing
-Runs suspicious programs in a controlled, isolated environment (a sand box)  to observe behavior 

## Anti-Virus(AV) Evasion techniques

- There are some Techniques to Evade not Being Detected by AV
  1. Packers
-Packer compresses an executable to make smaller in size
 2. Cryptor's/encoders
-They change the encryption algorithm/ it will locks
 3. Polymorphic malware
 - polymorphic malware changes it's code with wach infection, makig each instance of the malware unique. Like Hiv Aids ;)
 - 
4. Downloader & Dropper

- Many kinds of malware use programs called droppers or downloaders to learn about a system before installing the real malware. 
- Some of these droppers scope out a system first to avoid triggering security alerts when they download and install the real payload.

Fileless Malware

- Fileless malware operates entirely in memory, without writing any files to disk. 
    
- Since traditional antivirus software often focuses on scanning files, fileless malware can evade detection by avoiding the file system altogether.
- we use the key word 'curl' to download and  and display the html / code but if we type curl  weblink/filename  | bash


#### Python for Malware development
- let's see how we create some malwares based on algorithms.

- There are so many kinds of malware purpose
- Delete files
- Encrypt files
- Corrupt files
## Malware Prevention
1. Install anti-virus and anti-spywre software
a. Example: kaspersky, avg ,smadav
  2. Use Secure authenticaiton methods
  a. 2-factor/step authentication 
  b. Implement email security and spam protecion
  3. Keep software updated
  4. Use least - privilege method 
### Malware Analysis
- Malware analysis is a process of ananlyzing malwares. it is perfomed during information gathering of malware threat , and network intrusion
